        <p>
            An analysis of evolutionary statistics is proposed on the main column of Rule 30 of the elementary cellular automaton proposed by Stephen Wolfram, to examine the behavior of 5 million data points partitioned under different divisors, with the aim of studying the behavior and the relationship between zeros and ones.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Cellular Automata (CA, from now on) were conceived by John Von 
            Neumann in 1948 while trying to design a system capable of self-replication, that is, a robot capable of building another 
            robot. Physical limitations led him to follow the advice of Stanislaw Ulam, who suggested designing a discrete mathematical model 
            with this self-reproduction capability <a href="#referencias">[1]</a>.

            CA are defined as a set of cells that acquire different values depending on the interaction between them. 
            Mathematically, a CA is described by a 4-tuple:
        
            <center><p>\( CA=\{L,S,N,f\} \)</p></center>

            Where:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>\(L\)</b>: Dimensional space. Defines the dimensionality of a grid of grouped cells. This space is (theoretically) 
                    infinite.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>\(S\)</b>: Finite set of states that each cell within the assigned space can take.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>\(N\)</b>: Defines the relative positions of each cell that will form part of the neighborhood. The behavior of each cell 
                    depends on its neighborhood.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b><i>\(f:S^{[N]}\rightarrow S\) </i></b>: Transition function. Determines the next value of each cell based on the 
                    values of the neighboring cells. This update is performed simultaneously at each discrete time step.
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            These systems have been used to model subway stations <a href="#referencias">[2]</a>, pest behavior in ecosystems
            <a href="#referencias">[3]</a>, financial market systems <a href="#referencias">[4]</a>, or in the analysis of cancerous cell 
            behavior <a href="#referencias">[5]</a>. <br>
        
            Two of the most well-known CA are the Game of Life, proposed by John Conway, and the Elementary Cellular Automaton, developed by Stephen 
            Wolfram.<br>
        
            Conway's Game of Life consists of a set of cells in a two-dimensional space, a set of binary states (alive and 
            dead), a Moore neighborhood (the 8 surrounding cells), and a function that defines the life or death of each cell based on the 
            living population of its neighborhood <a href="#referencias">[6]</a>.<br>

            On the other hand, the Elementary Cellular Automaton is a collection of automata that share a one-dimensional space, a set of binary 
            states, and a neighborhood of radius one (the cell in question and its two closest neighbors). These automata differ 
            only in the transition function, which can adopt up to 256 different "rules" or configurations 
            <a href="#referencias">[7]</a>.<br>

            One of these rules, known and patented by Wolfram as Rule 30, shows erratic and seemingly random behavior. If it 
            starts with a single live cell, it expands in both directions with each iteration, being capable of filling the entire space. However, 
            the behavior of the initial cell does not seem to follow a discernible pattern <a href="#referencias">[8]</a>. Moreover, there doesn't 
            appear to be a bias toward one state over the other.<br>

            Therefore, this report proposes a statistical analysis over the first million generations, aiming to find a 
            pattern in the frequency of occurrence of ones and zeros for certain segmentations.<br>

        <h2>Theoretical Framework</h2>

        <section id="eca" class="contenido">
            <h3>Elementary Cellular Automaton</h3>

            The Elementary Cellular Automaton (ECA, from now on, for its English translation: "Elementary Cellular Automaton") is characterized by 
            its simplification of cellular automata and its divergent behavior. <br>

            Its main features are: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    One dimension: \(L=1\). That is, the cells are arranged in an infinite line consecutively.
		        </li>
                <li>
            		Two possible states per cell: <i>\(\{0,1\}\)</i>.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Local neighborhood: Each cellâ€™s neighborhood is defined by itself and its two closest neighbors, also known as radius 1. The 
                    relative position is given by <i>\(N=\{-1,0,1\}\)</i>.  
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transition functions: Since the neighborhood is made up of three cells and each cell can take two values, there are 
                    \(|S|^{|N|}=2^3=8\) possible neighborhood combinations. Furthermore, since each combination can have two production rules, that is, 
                    produce either a 0 or a 1, there are \(|S|^{|S|^{|N|}} = 2^{2^3} = 2^8 = 256\) different cellular automata.  
                </li>
            </ul>

            Each neighborhood combination can be associated with a binary number determined by the value of each cell. Since there are 8 
            combinations, each ECA can be represented by an 8-digit binary number, which, translated to decimal, gives 
            a value (and the name of the ECA) between 0 and 255. <br>

            Figure <a href="#fig1">1</a> shows the configuration of rule 210, which equals \(210_{10} = 11010010_2\) in binary. The 
            black boxes represent ones, and the white ones represent zeros.<br>

            The result of this rule is shown in figure <a href="#fig2">2</a>. A second dimension is used to represent the rule's history, even though the behavior only affects the original dimension.<br>

        <section id="rule30" class="contenido">
            <h3>Rule 30</h3>

            Rule 30 equals \(30_{10}=00011110_2\) in binary. Given a single cell with value 1, it expands in both directions with each 
            iteration, as shown in figures <a href="#fig3">3</a> and <a href="#fig4">4</a>, which illustrate the first 23 and 900 generations, 
            respectively. <br>
	
	        As seen in figure <a href="#fig4">4</a>, there is a small repeating pattern growing diagonally on the left side of the 
            history. However, on the right side, the behavior doesn't seem to have any stability or discernible pattern. If we store the 
            history of the values of the initial cell, we obtain a pseudorandom sequence. <br>
	
	        So far, it has not been possible to directly predict whether the next state will be 0 or 1; it can only be calculated by 
            running all previous generations. <br>

            Using the code function <a href="#lst1">1</a>, the first \(t\) generations of Rule 30 of the ECA are generated, and the history of the main column is extracted in list format. For the tests, a vector of \(t=5\) million generations was extracted.

        <section id="divisores" class="contenido">
            <h3>Divisor Generation</h3>
    
            A set of divisors is defined with function <a href="#lst2">2</a>. This consists of the first 100 natural numbers, along with all the prime numbers less than the square root of the total generations. That is, all primes less than \(\sqrt{5,000,000} = 2221\), which gives a total of 406 divisors. <br>
    
            The prime numbers were chosen for two reasons. The first is to reduce computational complexity. The second is based on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every number can be expressed as the product of prime numbers. This implies that, if there is a pattern in a number, such a pattern should also exist in its prime components. <br>
    
            Finally, the 2221 limit is defined because, for that number, there are as many partitions as can be made in the main column. The larger the divisor, the fewer the number of partitions, which in turn implies fewer data for analysis.

            <h3>Histograms</h3>
    
            To generate the histograms, the following steps are followed:
    
            <ul>
                <li>Select a <i>divisor</i>.</li>
                <li>Partition the main column vector into segments of size <i>divisor</i>.</li>

            </ul>
    
<section id="lst3" class="codigo">
<pre>Density = Function[{column, divisor},
    partitions = Partition[column, divisor];
    density = Table[
        Count[partitions[[i]], 1],

<span class="pie fun_ca">Code 4: Frequency recording</span>
</section>
    
        </section>
        
        When plotting the points, a normal distribution of the frequencies can be inferred, as shown in figure <a href="#fig5_6">5</a>. 
        In this case, a vector from the main column with 100,000 elements is used, partitioned into 10. On the other hand, in figure 
        <a href="#fig5_6">6</a>, using a vector of the same size but partitioned into 500, a chaotic behavior is observed. <br>
        
        This difference could be due to the number of data points each partition works with. With partition sizes of 10, we get 
        \(\frac{100,000}{10} = 10,000\) subvectors. In contrast, with partition sizes of 500, we get \(\frac{100,000}{500} = 200\) 
        subvectors, 50 times fewer than in the first case. <br>
        
        To make an adequate comparison, ideally, more data should be used as the partition size increases, so that all generate the same number of subvectors. However, increasing the number of generations increases processing time. 
        To avoid this, instead of increasing the size of the main column vector, a smaller vector is chosen and the aforementioned steps are repeated, but with different main vector sizes. <br>
        
        This new approach allows the analysis of the histogram behavior as the vector size increases.

    <h3>Evolutionary Histogram</h3>

    When implementing the evolutionary histograms, two additional parameters were added: the minimum vector size and the increment. These 
    values help reduce the number of operations performed, since increasing the vector size one divisor at a time is impractical and not very useful. 
    Also, not enough information is obtained by adding just one more data point. These values are generated and normalized 
    using function <a href="#lst5">5</a>. <br>

    For the 5 million generations, an initial value of 1 million and an increment of 100,000 were chosen. This allows us to obtain  
    \[
    \frac{(5,000,000 - 1,000,000)}{100,000} + 1 = 41
    \]  
    samples over time. <br>

    For the largest divisor (2221), the initial sample contains \(\frac{1,000,000}{2,221} = 450\) data points, while each additional time sample contains \(\frac{100,000}{2,221} = 40\) data points.<br>

    Finally, function <a href="#lst6">6</a> is used to calculate the evolutionary histograms for all generated divisors. 
    The size of each increment is adjusted to be an integer multiple of the divisor. <br>

    The following graphs represent the evolution of the evolutionary histograms of the first 100 integers and the next 306 prime numbers. <br>

    For the first values, the distributions seem to be preserved regardless of the number of obtained elements, forming what appears to be a Gaussian bell curve.
    <br>
    For larger numbers, the initial histograms seem to have an almost random behavior, but as the size of the main column vector increases, the same behavior as with smaller numbers is acquired.
    <br>
    We could conclude that, at least for the data seen in this experiment, if the number of ones and zeros is not equivalent given a certain partition, then there could be a risk of analyzing too few data points.
    Furthermore, the relationship between ones and zeros persists regardless of the partition or the size of the column considered.

    To conclude this first part, the graphs of mean, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis are obtained.
    The X-axis represents the result in the number of iterations starting with 1,000,000 data points and increasing by 100,000 up to 5 million.
    <br>

    The graphs of skewness and kurtosis have erratic behavior in the smallest vectors but, as observed in the previous point,
    this chaotic behavior depends on the amount of data, since the larger the iteration, the more stable it becomes.
